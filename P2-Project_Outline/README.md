## Submission Instructions

### Overview
FOODOKU
Foodoku will be a food/pantry management and meal planning web application. It will allow a user to create a basic meal plan for the week. A user will be able to manage what's in their pantry. It will have a bank of recipes pulled from three websites. The user will be able to search for recipes by ingredient(s) and be able to search for recipes based on their current pantry. From these searches the user will be able to create or generate grocery lists or find recipes where they currently already have all the ingredients.

This project was motivated by a need for a better meal planning and organizational tool in my home. I have a filing system of printed recipes from my favorite websites at my house and I try to make a new recipe at least once a week. However, I often forget to add all the ingredients from my new recipe(s) to my grocery list. Also, I wish I could easily browse the recipes from my files for ones where I already have all the ingredients in my pantry. This web application would be useful for others interested in meal planning and pantry organization.

### Features
-- DISTINCT USERS: Users will be able to create a new profile for themselves, allowing them to store their own pantry items and create personal meal plans. Users will be able to log in to the application. Each user will have a custom homepage showing their current pantry.
-- USER PANTRY: Allow a user to enter in food items into their pantry (possibly with quantities?).
-- RECIPES: Contains database of recipes from 3 websites. User will be able to add their own custom recipes to recipe database.
-- SEARCH: Users will be able to search recipes by ingredients.
-- CREATE GROCERY LIST: Users will be able to generate a grocery list based on the pantry inventory vs recipe selection. Users will be able to manually add to their grocery list.
-- MEAL PLANNER: Have an option to meal plan for the week in a Sun-Sat layout with areas for the User to enter their planned meal/notes.
