## Submission Instructions

### Overview
FOODOKU
I love to cook and meal plan. I have a filing system of printed recipes from my favorite websites at my house and I try to make a new recipe at least once a week. However, I often forget to add all the ingredients from my new recipe(s) to my grocery list. Also, I wish I could easily browse the recipes from my files for ones where I already have all the ingredients in my pantry. Hence came the idea for Foodoku!

Foodoku will be a web application that allows a user to search through recipes using a variety of search parameters; generate a grocery list; and manage what's in their pantry, fridge, and freezer. The application will have a bank of recipes pulled from three websites. The user will be able to search for recipes by ingredient(s) and be able to search for recipes based on their current pantry. From these searches the user will be able to create grocery lists or find recipes where they already have all the ingredients. Finally, the web application will have a basic meal planning weekly calendar to enter in their weekly meal plan.


### Features
-- USER LOGIN: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a custom homepage showing their current pantry.
-- USER PANTRY: Allow a user to enter in food items into their pantry (possibly with quantities?).
-- RECIPES: Contains database of recipes from 3 websites. User will be able to add their own custom recipes to recipe database.
-- SEARCH: Users will be able to search recipes by ingredients.
-- CREATE GROCERY LIST: Users will be able to generate a grocery list based on the pantry inventory vs recipe selection. Users will be able to manually add to their grocery list.
-- MEAL PLANNING: Have an option to meal plan for the week in a Sun-Sat layout with areas for the User to enter their planned meal/notes.
